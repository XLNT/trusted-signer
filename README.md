# âœ’ trusted-signer

This is a super simple typescript microservice that recovers and signs things with a private key. Don't expose this to the internet, obviously.

I made this because I couldn't get recovery and signatures to work in any language but javascript and instead of becoming smarter and learning how elliptic curve math works, I just wrote a microservice in node dot js.

## Deploy

It's a dockerfile, so run something like

```bash
yarn run build
docker build -t shrugs/trusted-signer:latest .
docker run -e "PRIVATE_KEY=0xabcd" -e "PORT=3002" -p 3002:3002 shrugs/trusted-signer:latest
```

(the first two commands are in `make build`)

## Usage

### `GET /recover`

}
```

Response

    "account": "0x7E75EdaBCE163EFee3E383Fc7C0a21720367f463"
}
```

### `POST /sign`

*NOTE:* right now, the sign endpoint is actually hashing your message and _then_ signing _that hash_. So it might not be exactly what you want. idk, it's what I wanted so that's what it does.

Give it your message as a hex string.

Request
```
{
	"message": "0x09d38b730edd61dc917e2c365e24c2312193e81e7e75edabce163efee3e383fc7c0a21720367f463"
}
```

Response
